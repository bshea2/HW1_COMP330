LAKE FOREST, Ill. – Attention fantasy football owners: Chicago Bears rookie Tarik Cohen deserves a spot in your starting lineup.
“The main thing I heard coming into this week was people being like, ‘I had you on my bench. I should’ve started you. I’m a believer now,” Cohen said before Wednesday's practice.

Cohen made a lot of people believers in Week 1 when he totaled 158 all-purpose yards, the most ever by a Bears rookie in his season-debut, and a touchdown in Chicago's 23-17 loss to Atlanta.
